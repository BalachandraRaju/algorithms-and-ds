Data Structures and Algorithms in C++
==============================

I'm reviewing some of my text books that I've been using to learn data structures and algorithms.

### With so many implementations, why another repository?

* I decided to put my code here to keep track of my progress.
* I like to solve programming problems. Copy and paste is easy but adapt/combine algorithms to solve a problem is something else...
* I don't usually use much C++, so I think this is a nice way to keep in mind some STL methods and the language itself
* "With advanced libraries and languages, you can accomplish some tasks without knowing Algorithms and Data Structures, but you can do much more with such knowledge.
  This is the bound between programmers and novices."
