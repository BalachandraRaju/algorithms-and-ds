Data Structures and Algorithms in C++
==============================

I'm reviewing some of my text books when I was learning data structures and algorithms.

### With so many implementations, why another repository?

* I decided to put my code here to keep track of my progress.
* I like to solve programming problems. Put solutions to copy and paste it later
  is easy but adapt/combine algorithms to solve a problem is something else...
* I don't usually use C++ in my working place, so I think this is a nice way to keep in mind some STL methods
* **With advanced libraries and languages, you can accomplish some tasks without knowing Algorithms and Data Structures, but you can do much more with such knowledge.
  This is the bound between programmers and novices.**
