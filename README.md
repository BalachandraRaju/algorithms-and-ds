Algorithms and Data Structures
==============================

*"With advanced libraries and languages, you can accomplish some tasks without knowing Algorithms and Data Structures, but you can do much more with such knowledge. This is the bound between programmers and novices."* (Robert Sedgewick - Algorithms Part 1)

##About##
I created this repository to practice more the subject. As I'm studying, I implement problems and algorithms and push them here.

Algorithms are organized by subjects (e.g. Searching, Sorting, etc...). For each problem, I create a common interface and have different classes implementing the problem's interface. I designed the classes to be concise and to provide enough information so you don't have to check any other files. Therefore, expect to see some duplicated code. The main concern here, is mastering the art of computer programming.

I hope you find the information here useful for you.
